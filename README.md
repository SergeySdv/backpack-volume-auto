DELAY_BETWEEN_DEAL = (0, 0)  # Delay in seconds between completed trade cycles
NEEDED_TRADE_VOLUME = 0  # Target trading volume in USD (0 = unlimited)

TRADE_AMOUNT = [0, 0]  # Min and max amount per trade in USD (0 = use full balance)
ALLOWED_ASSETS = ["SOL_USDC", "PYTH_USDC", ...]  # Trading pairs to use
```

GRID_TRADING_PAIRS = ["SOL_USDC"]  # Trading pairs for grid trading
GRID_LEVELS = 5  # Number of grid levels on each side (buy/sell)

## Trading Modes

### Standard Volume Trading
The default mode generates trading volume by continuously buying and selling assets. This is useful for:
- Meeting volume requirements for rewards programs
- Maintaining activity on your account
- Simple trading automation

To use this mode, set `ENABLE_GRID_TRADING = False` in the config.

### Grid Trading
Grid trading places multiple buy and sell orders at regular intervals around the current market price, automatically profiting from price volatility.

Key benefits:
- Automated buying low and selling high
- Position tracking with weighted average entry price
- Take profit targets based on position entry
- Automatic order repositioning when market moves significantly

To use this mode:
1. Set `ENABLE_GRID_TRADING = True` in the config
2. Configure your desired pairs in `GRID_TRADING_PAIRS`
3. Adjust grid parameters (`GRID_LEVELS`, `GRID_SPREAD`, etc.)
4. Set your profit target with `TAKE_PROFIT_PERCENTAGE`

For detailed information on grid trading, see the [Grid Trading Documentation](core/position_management/README.md).
