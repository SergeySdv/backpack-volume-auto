## Configuration Guide üìß

All settings can be customized in `inputs/config.py`:

### General Settings
```python
CONVERT_ALL_TO_USDC = False  # When True, sells all assets to USDC instead of trading
THREADS = 1  # Number of parallel threads to run
DEPTH = 3  # Market depth for order execution (1-20, higher = more slippage)
```

### Volume Trading Settings
```python
DELAY_BETWEEN_TRADE = (1, 2)  # Delay in seconds between buy and sell operations
DELAY_BETWEEN_DEAL = (0, 0)  # Delay in seconds between completed trade cycles
NEEDED_TRADE_VOLUME = 0  # Target trading volume in USD (0 = unlimited)
MIN_BALANCE_TO_LEFT = 0  # Minimum balance to maintain (in USD)
TRADE_AMOUNT = [0, 0]  # Min and max amount per trade in USD (0 = use full balance)
ALLOWED_ASSETS = ["SOL_USDC", "PYTH_USDC", ...]  # Trading pairs to use
```

### Position Management & Grid Trading
```python
# Grid Trading Configuration
ENABLE_GRID_TRADING = False  # Set to True to enable grid trading mode
GRID_TRADING_PAIRS = ["SOL_USDC"]  # Trading pairs for grid trading
GRID_LEVELS = 5  # Number of grid levels on each side (buy/sell)
GRID_SPREAD = 0.01  # Price difference between grid levels (1% = 0.01)
GRID_ORDER_SIZE = None  # Order size (None = auto-calculate)
TAKE_PROFIT_PERCENTAGE = 3.0  # Take profit target for sell orders
```

## Trading Modes

### Standard Volume Trading
The default mode generates trading volume by continuously buying and selling assets. This is useful for:
- Meeting volume requirements for rewards programs
- Maintaining activity on your account
- Simple trading automation

To use this mode, set `ENABLE_GRID_TRADING = False` in the config.

### Grid Trading
Grid trading places multiple buy and sell orders at regular intervals around the current market price, automatically profiting from price volatility.

Key benefits:
- Automated buying low and selling high
- Position tracking with weighted average entry price
- Take profit targets based on position entry
- Automatic order repositioning when market moves significantly

To use this mode:
1. Set `ENABLE_GRID_TRADING = True` in the config
2. Configure your desired pairs in `GRID_TRADING_PAIRS`
3. Adjust grid parameters (`GRID_LEVELS`, `GRID_SPREAD`, etc.)
4. Set your profit target with `TAKE_PROFIT_PERCENTAGE`

For detailed information on grid trading, see the [Grid Trading Documentation](core/position_management/README.md).

## Utility Scripts

The project includes several utility scripts to help manage your trading:

### Balance Checking

To check balances for all your accounts:

```bash
python check_balances.py
```

On Windows, you can use the `CHECK_BALANCES.bat` file:
```
CHECK_BALANCES.bat
```

This will show a table of all assets across all accounts in your accounts.txt file.

### Closing Orders

To close all open orders (useful for stopping grid trading, or in case of emergencies):

```bash
# Close all open orders on all pairs
python close_all_orders.py

# Close orders for a specific pair
python close_all_orders.py SOL_USDC
```

On Windows, you can use the `CLOSE_ORDERS.bat` file, optionally with a trading pair:
```
CLOSE_ORDERS.bat SOL_USDC
```

This will cancel all open orders for your account on Backpack Exchange.

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite for verifying grid trading functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Run specific tests
python run_tests.py tests/unit/test_bot_worker.py
```

The tests cover:
- Position tracking calculations
- Grid price calculations
- Order management
- Take profit logic
- Price deviation handling
- Multiple bot management
