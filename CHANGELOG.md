# Backpack Trading Bot - Changelog

## Feature Branch: Position Management

This feature branch significantly enhances the original volume generation bot with grid trading, position management, and utility tools.

### Grid Trading System

A complete grid trading implementation has been added:

- **Grid Order Placement**: Automatically places buy orders below current price and sell orders above
- **Position Tracking**: Calculates weighted average entry price and total position size
- **Take Profit Logic**: Sets sell orders at profitable levels based on average entry
- **Dynamic Grid Adjustment**: Repositions grid when price moves outside the range
- **Minimum Order Size**: Enforces exchange minimum requirements
- **Auto-Sizing**: Calculates appropriate order sizes based on available balance
- **Insufficient Funds Handling**: Gracefully handles low balance conditions

### Utility Scripts

New utility scripts make account management easier:

- **check_balances.py**: Show balances for all accounts in a table format
- **close_all_orders.py**: Cancel open orders for specific or all trading pairs
- **Windows Batch Files**: Easy-to-use .bat files for all utilities

### Error Handling Improvements

Enhanced error handling throughout the codebase:

- **Session Management**: Proper cleanup of API connections
- **Detailed Logging**: More informative logs with emojis and clear formatting
- **Balance Requirements**: Clear feedback on minimum balance requirements
- **Status Reporting**: Better reporting of order status and execution

### Testing Framework

A comprehensive test suite has been added:

- **Unit Tests**: Cover core grid trading functionality
- **Async Tests**: Test network operations with mock clients
- **Test Runner**: Simple script to run tests with configurable options

### Configuration Options

The config.py file has been extended with new options:

```python
# Grid Trading Configuration
ENABLE_GRID_TRADING = False  # Set to True to enable grid trading mode
GRID_TRADING_PAIRS = ["SOL_USDC"]  # Trading pairs for grid trading
GRID_LEVELS = 5  # Number of grid levels on each side (buy/sell)
GRID_SPREAD = 0.01  # Price difference between grid levels (1% = 0.01)
GRID_ORDER_SIZE = None  # Order size (None = auto-calculate)
TAKE_PROFIT_PERCENTAGE = 3.0  # Take profit target for sell orders
```

### Documentation Updates

- Comprehensive README updates with feature explanations
- Detailed instructions for each feature
